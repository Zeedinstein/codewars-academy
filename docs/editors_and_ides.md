# Editors & IDE's

There are many text editors and IDE's that support Python syntax highlighting and code completion.
The main text editors that we recommend are:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/)

But you may use whatever text editor/IDE you are comfortable with.
Some text editors will need extensions for more advanced support for Python.
