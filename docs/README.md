# CodeWars Academy

### What is this?
> We started this a year ago with a couple of friends wanting to learn to code. A year on, we're ready to grow the group and offer more people this opportunity. The idea is to create an environment to learn to code, so that you're not a pilgrim climbing a treacherous mountain alone.

> Join others who want to see what coding is all about.

> Bring your laptop and a hunger to learn - we will feed you with knowledge and snacks!
